# iblvideo
Scripts for video recording on the dedicated video computer that comes with every recording rig.
Prerequisites are python 3 and pycapture from FLIR/PointGrey. To record from multiple PointGrey cameras, download this repository, open ConfigureCameras.py and adjust the path to your disk where the videos should be stored (savePath), then run MasterVideo.py inside the iblvideo folder to start video acquisition.
