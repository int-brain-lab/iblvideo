These scripts are the equivalent to the scripts in capture, translated to the pyspin syntax. This requires spinnaker and the spinnaker_python wrapper:

This script allows high frequency recording from up to 3 cameras but not more. It saves images frist in a list and then appends them all to an avi file (unlike the corresponding pycap script).

pyspin works with Ubunut 18 while pycap only works with ubuntu 16.04.
